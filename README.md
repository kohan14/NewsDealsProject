Project - news about electronics
Hi, My name is Piotr and this is my first ever at coding something on my own.
The idea is to make a News Website about good deals on consumer electronics from various internet shops.
Before starting out i have learn't basics of C#, HTML5, CSS3, ASP.NET Core, LINQ, Entity Framework.

I Planned my work following Design-Development Phase Plan. I'll be going through phases like ideation, design, development and launch.
All the progress i made is stored in Design-Development_Phase_Plan.xls !

The ultimate goal is to start doing something i enjoy for the living.
